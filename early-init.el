;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs 27 introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.
;;

;;; Code:

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. We handle package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; `use-package' is builtin since 29
;; It must be set before loading `use-package'.
(setq use-package-enable-imenu-support t)

;; Setup auto-compile in early-init.el 
(setq load-prefer-newer t)
(let ((dir (file-name-directory (or load-file-name buffer-file-name))))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lib/compat" dir))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lib/packed" dir))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lib/auto-compile" dir)))
(require 'auto-compile)
(auto-compile-on-load-mode)
(auto-compile-on-save-mode)

;; Inhibit resizing frame
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)
(push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)
(when (featurep 'ns)
  (push '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t) default-frame-alist))


;; Local Variables:
;; no-byte-compile: nil
;; indent-tabs-mode: nil
;; End:
;;; early-init.el ends here
